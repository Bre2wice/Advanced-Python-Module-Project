OVERVIEW
In this mini-project, you will create a hero character and battle the powerful Evil Wizard. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to extend starter code, customize your character, and add new functionality. Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. Your task is to modify the starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing your own logic and design.
